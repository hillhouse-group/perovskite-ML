Data acquisition is a somewhat complex task requiring coordination of up to seven distinct instruments (microscope camera, filter cube wheel motor, LED light source, sourcemeter 1 and 2, waveform generator,lock-in amplifier). Most of these can be controlled through Python scripts by making use of the appropriate pymeasure modules. The camera is controlled using MicroManager software in the BeanShell language, but we have developed these into Python subprocesses that can be called within the main control script. The filter cube wheel motor is driven by an Arduino UNO and communicates with Python using serial communication through the "motor_update_slider" module if the correct program has been loaded onto the Arduino beforehand.
