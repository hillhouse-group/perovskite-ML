# Featurizer Notebooks

These notebooks contain the final post-processing steps necessary to get the experimental data in the proper format for modeling. In either film or device notebooks, an arbitrary number of experiments are provided as a list at the start of each notebook. From the timeseries data generated by the analysis pipeline for each of the specified experiment, the notebook will generate a list of values of predictive features and condense them into a Pandas DataFrame in standard format, where each row represents a specific experiment and each column represents a specific feature. At the end of each notebook, the DataFrame is exported as a CSV that may be loaded into the final modeling notebook.
