# Experimental Protocols

This directory contains an overview of how the experimental apparatus used in perovskite film and device degradation experiments is set up, and standard operating procedures for each type of experiment (single-composition films, composition gradient films, and full devices (solar cells).

The overview document is meant to be a high-level description of how the instruments are set up and (where applicable) calibrated, and is intentionally made without reference to specific models of the instruments. The SOPs are more detailed instructions for setting up runs on the instruments developed within the Hillhouse Group, and thus some of them may not directly apply in every case but are given here in an effort to provide an exhaustive description.
