# Modeling Notebooks

After the desired experimental data have been rendered down into a Pandas DataFrame and saved in CSV format, the modeling notebooks will read them in and use them to train machine learning models. Additional features may be constructed after reading in the data (although it is recommended to do so only during development and to try to maintain feature construction in the featurizer notebooks as much as possible). The modeling problem may be set up by choosing subsets of available features (generally our datasets are significantly smaller than the number of available features, so some judgment is needed in how this is done), deciding whether to transform the target variable (i.e. using the logarithm if its values span more than an order of magnitude across the dataset), selecting modeling approaches (e.g., LASSO vs. ridge regression vs. pursuit algorithms), and partitioning the dataset into test/train splits. After training and testing the model, the results may be visualized in the form of parity plots, bar plots of coefficients, and error distributions. Model stability may be assessed via conformal prediction using the jackknife+ algorithm.
